     		 GETTING TO KNOW YOU
      		</h1>
            <p>Across from where? Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Across from where?</p> 

            <p>I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.</p> 

            <p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? I'm half machine. I'm a monster. That's why you always leave a note!</p> 
            <p>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I've opened a door here that I regret.</p> 

            <p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Steve Holt!</p>
