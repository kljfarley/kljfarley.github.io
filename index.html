<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a Marketing and Programming Coordinator, living in Melbourne. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I occasionally do freelance graphic work and would like to build websites for clients instead of outsourcing.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a self employed director of a creative agency so I can take my future Boston Terrier to work with me.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Co-Founder</strong>, Special Sauce<m><br>
<em>Melbourne, 2013 - Present</em></li>

<br>

<li><strong>Marketing and Programming Coordinator</strong>, Marriner Group<br>
<em>Melbourne, 2011 - Present</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bachelor of Multimedia (Media Studies)</strong>, Swinburne University, Melbourne<br><em>2008-2010</em></li>
</ul>
